<h1>Why Linux will never win the desktop</h1>
<time>2012-11-17</time>
<hr>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m a huge linux fan. I use it on all my
machines(even my phone,
<a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/?capcode=AGE" title="Android phones">Android</a>
is basically linux) and even converted my sister and a few friends. But
if you don&rsquo;t convert somebody, chance they&rsquo;ll try a new operating system
is slim to none. Only geeks like me install funky stuff as their primary
software just to try it.
But the major problem lies somewhere else. <strong>People hate making
choices.</strong> And linux is all about cohice. It gives you power and you
choose what you&rsquo;ll do with it. And it starts with selecting selecting
distribution.</p>
<p><a href=http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/30362832.jpg><img src=http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/30362832.jpg alt></a></p>
<p><strong>You don&rsquo;t install linux.</strong> You install a distribution. You install
<a href=http://www.debian.org/ title=Debian>Debian</a>,
<a href=http://www.ubuntu.com/ title="Ubuntu (operating system)">Ubuntu</a>,
<a href=http://www.slackware.com/ title=Slackware>Slackware</a>,
<a href=http://www.fedoraproject.org/ title="Fedora (operating system)">Fedora</a>&mldr;
There&rsquo;s a sea of different versions what to choose! I would even argue
that all this fragmentation hurts development. Sure it&rsquo;s great to have
different implementations and approaches and let time what&rsquo;s the best.
But there is also quite a lot of duplicate work being done. And this
cost&rsquo;s time and money that could be put to better use.
Back to choices. I like choice. I have a problem and need a piece of
software(or hardware) and spend a few hours(or days) browsing the web
looking at pros and cons, reading reviews, testing stuff, or just
surfing the ebay and hunt for good prices. I like to do this for fun.
But I hate doing it when I need to get something done. And most people
just need software to get stuff done. They don&rsquo;t care about open source
spirit or ability to hack around&mldr;they just need something that solves
their problem. And when you have a solution, why change? Why fix
something that isn&rsquo;t broken?</p>
<p>I attended a great talk on future of web search(by @dusano) and somebody
addressed this problem&mldr;”Why fix search if it ain&rsquo;t broken?”. Answer
was along the lines of “Because if you don&rsquo;t somebody else will. And he
will dominate the industry”. I&rsquo;m not quite sure this is so true in the
short run. It&rsquo;s like with promotions in the supermarket. People are used
to buying one brand of product and consciously selecting another is
equivalent to mental <strong>work</strong>. And people are lazy. So they&rsquo;ll avoid
thinking about possibilities because frankly they don&rsquo;t care enough
about value/price ratio of their coffee to invest their time into it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s similar when it comes to software and computers in general. A
colleague once said that people who don&rsquo;t understand how computers work
shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to use them(he&rsquo;s linux sysadmin), but I strongly
disagree. People want to use computers as tools and they should be able
to. Not everybody is a developer! And that&rsquo;s why
<a href=http://www.apple.com/macosx/ title="Mac OS">MacOS</a> is popular. See
<a href=http://www.microsoft.com/WINDOWS title=Windows>Windows</a> is here from the
dawn of time. At least from youngster like me who used computer for the
first time in this millenia.
MacOS might be a
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution title="Berkeley Software Distribution">BSD</a>
but it&rsquo;s only one and it&rsquo;s locked down. It doesn&rsquo;t give you options but
everything works. Perfect for most people.</p>
<p>Luckily things are changing for the better. Ubuntu broke the “easy
linux” taboo and make things friendlier. And on my laptop I have <a href=http://www.linuxmint.com/ title="Linux Mint">Linux
Mint</a> which is even better.
Installation is super easy and everything works out of the box. And I&rsquo;m
writing this post because a friend posted a video about ElementaryOS
which is another Ubuntu fork that looks very much Mac-esque.</p>
<p>So things like Ubuntu, Mint or Elementary might have a fighting chance
on the desktop if they try real hard. But most of the converted users
won&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re actually running linux under the hood. Anyway I
should stop blabbering about desktop and focus on post-pc era. But
that&rsquo;s a whole other story.</p>
