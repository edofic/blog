This post
is a flashback I had today. It might be a bit fiction as my memory about
events tends to be fuzzy at times. But I promise it at least resembles
the real story.
I was in <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_school title="Elementary school">elementary
school</a>
and just found out about programming and was learning about c++. After
reading &ldquo;<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B title=C++>C++</a> na kolenih&rdquo;
by Goran Bervar I was empowered by knowledge and tried to do all sorts
of projects. Mostly in console. Stuff like subtitle format converter -
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Invented_Here title="Not Invented Here">NIH
syndrome</a>.
I was a bit frustrated because I couldn't find any books about windows
programming in the library. Yes, library was may primary source of
information, because
my <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language title="English language">English</a> was
not nearly good enough for technical stuff.
I might add here I worked on
<a href=http://www.microsoft.com/WINDOWS title=Windows>Windows</a> 98(and later XP)
with <a href=http://www.bloodshed.net%2c/ title=Dev-C++>DevC++</a>. I found out about
<a href=http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us title="Microsoft Visual Studio">Visual
Studio</a>
in a few years and did some Windows development.
I digressed a bit. Then came the most optimistic idea. A <a href="http://www.symantec.com/theme.jsp?themeid=protect-virtual-environments" title="Virtual machine">virtual
machine</a>.
Something quite high level(instruction to print) an eventually an
assembler. I now realize I was always <a href=/posts/2012-08-29-creating-a-language-1>into language
stuff</a>.
So a designed a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code title="Machine code">machine
language</a> with
just enough instructions to do <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program title="Hello world program">Hello
World</a>,
that is PRINT and END.</p><h3 id=implementation>Implementation</h3><p>At first I thought about doing a monolithic structure - <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_statement title="Switch statement">switch
case</a>(in
fact what I've <a href=/posts/2012-08-29-creating-a-language-1>done with scrat
recently</a>).
But I had some considerations. What if number of of instruction rises a
lot? I'll be left maintaining <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code title="Spaghetti code">spaghetti
code</a>. Or
at least I thought that's what spaghetti code looks like, but in
retrospective I believe I had a good taste anyway. </p><p>But I tried that anyway. Just for kicks. Did whole machine as one class
that had an array for memory and a single point of entry - boot. It run
a loop a while loop with
PC&lt;-PC+1,
fetched instruction from memory, switched on them, called appropriate
method to implement that instruction and looped. Even had registers. I
think my current professor of Computer Architecture(this course brought
back the memory) might actually be proud if he heard what I did back
then. </p><h3 id=pointers>Pointers</h3><p>I was always quite comfortable with pointers. I don't now, they're
mathematicky concept. I like such stuff. Or perhaps it was because I was
young when I was introduced into the matter and wasn't spoiled with
automatic memory management(which I quite like nowadays). </p><p>So I tried with <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_pointer title="Function pointer">function
pointers</a>.
C is cool enough to let you have pointers to functions! And that means
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function title="Higher-order function">higher order
functions</a>.
But I didn't know about math enough to appreciate the concept as I do
now. But still - I thought it's extremely cool. So I did a function that
halted execution and printed out &ldquo;no such instruction&rdquo;. Why you ask?
Well I did a 256-cell table(8-bit instruction) of pointers to functions.
Now I didn't have to switch - just a look-up and invocation. Great.
Apart from the fact it doesn't work. </p><p>Compiler said something along the lines of &ldquo;You cannot make a table of
pointers to functions!". I was puzzled. Skip 10 years into the future.
Today I was rethinking this and thought about casting the pointer. All
the functions would be void->void so I can cast back no problem. A
table of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_%28computing%29 title="Pointer (computing)">void
pointers</a>
and casting. Yay!</p><p>Now 10 years back. I didn't think about casting the pointer. Type info
was sacred to me!</p><p>So I &ldquo;invented&rdquo; <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_object title="Function object">function
objects</a>.</p><h3 id=objects>Objects</h3><p>I swear to god I have not heard about function objects back then. It
wasn't until this year reading Bloch's Efficient Java where he talks
about strategy objects. I immediately recognized my idea. So now I had
many classes, every one implementing execute method. And I had an array
of these objects. Now I did a look-up and invocation on an object.
Sweet. And it even worked. But sadly I dropped the project and went on
to graphics. Learnt SDL and did Tic-Tac-Toe. And dreamed about doing a
vector 3D engine(curves baby!). Which until this day I didn't try to
implement. Maybe I'll try in near future. </p><hr width=100%><p style=color:#777>Last modified on 2013-10-18</p></div></div><nav class=post-pagination><a class=newer-posts href=/posts/2014-01-08-hakyll/>Next<br>Hakyll</a>
