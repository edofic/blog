    <h1>Moving to Hugo</h1>

    <hr/>
    <p>If you&rsquo;ve been here before you might notice the site looks different. Indeed I
moved my content to yet another platform (first it was blogspot -&gt; hakyll).</p>
<p>I wanted to publish something but I ran into issues: my toolchain did not work.
See, I&rsquo;ve been doing less Haskell on my machine lately and negligence led into
my setup rotting (as I did upgrade my machine quite a bit). Truth  be told the
infrastructure was not designed to last the test of time. Anyways after a few
rounds of debugging I once decided to finally give up my complicated custom
setup and move to something off-the-shelf so I can focus on writing.</p>
<h3 id="hakyll">Hakyll</h3>
<p>This may come as a bit surprising but <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> is
not actually a ready-made tool. Rather it&rsquo;s a Haskell library to write your own
static page generator. This means it&rsquo;s super customizable but it also means you
need to own your generator and give it some love. Which I did for a while. But
when I stopped I ran into trouble.</p>
<p>But I wanted to keep my content. Preferably also the general architecture: keep
posts in markdown and generate static html pages for publishing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m and engineer by heart and I&rsquo;m the first to admit I love playing with shiny
new tools. So why not jump ship and move to something new? Maybe something
easier to maintain.</p>
<h3 id="choosing-new-tools">Choosing new tools</h3>
<p>With the hype around &ldquo;JAM stack&rdquo; and static page generation I imagined there is
a proliferation of tooling focusing on my issue. A web search quickly led me to
<a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">staticgen.com</a> - a site dedicated to providing a
list of tools. Perfect.</p>
<p>Few names sounded familiar. But reading descriptions I figured out I have a few
more requirements. I don&rsquo;t want do deal with frontend frameworks
(React/Vue/etc) - I want my content in markdown. And I also want my tools fast,
easy to install/maintain and fully featured - no hacking to set up RSS (yes I
want to support RSS in 2020 :D).</p>
<p>A lot of research and playing around later I settled on
<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. I ticks all my boxes, plus it&rsquo;s written in
<a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> which is probably my main language at the moment so
I&rsquo;m very familiar with the tooling and thus comfortable handling
installs/maintenance.</p>
<p>So Hugo it is.</p>
<h3 id="the-migration">The migration</h3>
<p>Since Hugo works by the same principle - content in markdown + templates - it
was quite straightforward. Copied over my content, updated the slight
differences in metadata with a quick vim macro, whip up a basic config based on
the tutorial et voila: blog was rendering. Well I took an off the shelf template
to begin with. Then some modification to get it quite right and I was very
happy. No code to maintain, just content, template, and a config file.</p>
<h3 id="verdict">Verdict</h3>
<p>The part that&rsquo;s actually impressive is the default features and speed make
for really pleasant experience. Out of the box I had automatic rebuilds with
file watching, nice error messages for when I make a mistake and even automatic
browser refreshes. And the whole thing is so quick that by the time I save in my
editor and switch to browser it already rebuilt, refreshed the page and
rendered. Feels instant. I love it.</p>
<p>With technical hurdles removed maybe I&rsquo;ll start writing more again.</p>
