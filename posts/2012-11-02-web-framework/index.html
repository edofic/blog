application and I want to learn something. So I&rsquo;m on the hunt for
language, environment and framework.</p><h3 id=other-stuff>Other stuff</h3><p>I did some <a href=http://www.php.net/ title=PHP>PHP</a> a few years back
and definitely don&rsquo;t want to go there anymore. I also did some
<a href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework title=".NET Framework">.NET</a> and it&rsquo;s
even part of curriculum here at FRI. But clicking on wizards in <a href=http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us title="Microsoft Visual Studio">Visual
Studio</a>
feels weird to me. Not like development should be done. And I also use
GNU/Linux as my primary(and only)
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system title="Operating system">OS</a>,
so that&rsquo;s out of the water. I did read about <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages title="JavaServer Pages">java server
pages</a>
and faces and even tried few things out. But luckily I didn&rsquo;t get to do
this project I was preparing for and I didn&rsquo;t need it. It looked ugly
anyway. I did some flirting with
<a href=http://code.google.com/webtoolkit title="Google Web Toolkit">GWT</a>, does that
even count as a web framework? </p><h3 id=nodejs>Node.js</h3><p>I heard about <a href=http://nodejs.org/ title=Node.js>nodejs</a> quite some time ago
but I put off looking into it because my js was really rusty. But
recently I brushed up on my javascript skills(to do a &ldquo;compiler&rdquo; into
js) and gave it a shot. Node is good. It&rsquo;s fast, it&rsquo;s agile, it makes
you think in a different way. I was feeling empowered. I did some simple
stuff and I liked it.</p><h3 id=static-vs-dynamic>Static vs dynamic</h3><p>Later I kinda got a job as <a href=http://rubyonrails.org/ title="Ruby on Rails">Ruby on
Rails</a> dev. And I hated it. So
I didn&rsquo;t take it. It would take up too much time anyway - I&rsquo;m a student.
Ruby is okay. Rails is okay. But problem was the size of the problem.
Application we were buiding(a team of devs) was quite complex and I came
into existing(moderate size) ruby code base. Learning ruby and rails as
I go was fun, but navigating the project was pain in the ass. Of course
documentation was non existent and
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment title="Integrated development environment">IDE</a>
couldn&rsquo;t help me because it didn&rsquo;t know. So a lot of regex searching and
walking around asking stuff. Also refactoring&mldr;Inevitable but hard. </p><p>This cemented my opinion on static vs dynamic typing. (Static for
everything but a short script, more on that another time).</p><h3 id=scala>Scala</h3><p>Then I learned about the good parts of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system title="Type system">static
typing</a> through
scala and haskell. Doing web in haskell seems a bit intimidating(I will
give it a go eventually, I promise) so I roll with scala. I looks there
are two big names here. Play! and Lift. I watched a few talks and read
few blogs about both to see central points. </p><p>Big difference seems to be their view on state. Lift goes for stateful,
Play for stateless. Play kinda seems like it has a bigger community, but
their documentation is stellar and they&rsquo;re now part of Typesafe stack.
No brainer then. Play it is.</p><h3 id=play-frameworkhttpwwwplayframeworkorg-play-framework><a href=http://www.playframework.org/ title="Play Framework">Play! framework</a></h3><p>I dived into documentation. Reading samples and explanation about
infrastructure and
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface title="Application programming interface">APIs</a>.
Samples really clicked with me - it felt like porn. No analogy, reading
elegant scala sources for a web app for my first time felt like I was
doing something naughty, like things shouldn&rsquo;t be that good.</p><p>Live reloading is great too. A friend of mine is a J2EE dev and he&rsquo;s
constantly nagging about build and deploy times. I get that near
instantaneous. And <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compile_time title="Compile time">compile
time</a> checking
of routes and templates? Oh my god, yes. Bear in mind, compile time is
all the time. When I hit ctrl-s for &ldquo;save all open files&rdquo; I quickly see
if compiler has any complaints, even before I refresh the browser. </p><p>I just did some experimenting with features&mldr;for a few hours.
Everything feels so simple but powerful. Why nobody told me about this
before?</p><p>Okay, it has to have some weaknesses but I didn&rsquo;t find them. Yet. And
that&rsquo;s what counts.</p><h3 id=herokuhttpwwwherokucom-heroku><a href=http://www.heroku.com/ title=Heroku>Heroku</a></h3><p>Now this is just a cherry for the top of my cake. It took me two minutes
to deploy my hello world app, and that includes time needed to install
Heroku&rsquo;s tookkit. You just create an app and push to remote git repo.
Heroku detects it&rsquo;s a Play/Scala app and install dependencies. Rest is
done by SBT. And it just works. Hassle free deployment for developers.
Yay.</p><p>Now I have my stack and even a host. So I just need to write an awesome
service and generate traffic. <a href="http://www.google.si/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=6&cad=rja&ved=0CFEQtwIwBQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DnVE09yyznfc&ei=jAKUUIPEDdGN4gTR5YCwDg&usg=AFQjCNFEfy9P-ultVxu5ZkJgFIV4m1aODA&sig2=OX1AHn6wJRVV3cca7L1vnQ">How hard can it
be?</a></p><hr><p>Last modified on 2012-11-02</p><a href=/posts/2012-10-29-hlist-shapeless/>Previous Cool Monday - HList and Shapeless</a><br><a href=/posts/2012-11-05-hindley-milner/>Next Cool Monday - Hindley-Milner on a dynamic language</a></div></body></html>
