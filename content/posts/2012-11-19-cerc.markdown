title: Cool Monday - CERC and my trip to Krakow
date: 2012-11-19
---

This week's post is a bit different. Well very different. My team
qualified for [CERC ICPC](http://icpc.baylor.edu/public/worldMap/1317)(european programming
contest) and that means a trip to [Krakow,
Poland](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=50.0613888889,19.9383333333&spn=0.1,0.1&q=50.0613888889,19.9383333333%20(Kraków)&t=h "Kraków").
I plan on writing this in a journal style. A bit every day.


### Friday, 11. am

I got up at 6. to check news and read a bit before departing. And of
course to charge my laptop and phone to 100% batter for the long trip.
Then a 10 minute walk across
[Ljubljana](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=46.0555555556,14.5083333333&spn=0.1,0.1&q=46.0555555556,14.5083333333%20(Ljubljana)&t=h "Ljubljana")(quite
cold outside) and bus left at 7.15am. Yes, we're riding a bus. And we
will be riding this bus for quite some time. Approximately 12 hours
total! I guess it would be cheaper to buy plane tickets for low end
jet-line than renting a bus(and two drivers) for whole weekend. Not to
mention faster. Twelve hours!!

Anyway, first stop is Maribor to pick up some more teams and eat
sandwiches. By the time we left
[Slovenia](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=46.05,14.5&spn=10.0,10.0&q=46.05,14.5%20(Slovenia)&t=h "Slovenia")
it was already 10 am. I honestly didn't know it takes that much to get
from the country.

And it's kinda boring here on bus. Since we're in a foreign country I'm
in a roaming network and data can get pricey. So no internets for me. At
least the hotel we're staying in should have wifi.

Life gets boring here. I've talked to some interesting people..but then
everybody got to do something. Bus has a [DVD
player](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD_player "DVD player"), but it
only plays [DVDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD "DVD"), no avi or and
other format. And of course the only thing we've got was
twenty-something
[Poirot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercule_Poirot "Hercule Poirot")
moveis. Not my thing. Somebody bought some empty DVD at the gas
station(they have those there!!) and we've had an adventure trying to
burn something. Success. But approximately two guys at the front are
watching Poirot currently so we'll have to wait to see if it had in fact
worked.

Oh yeah, and I can't read(or program for that matter) on a bus because
reading vibrating text makes me nauseas. It's funny how I'm writing
this. Laptop in my lap(that's why it's called a laptop!), screen
brightness to minimum, typing and looking through the windows and around
the bus. I occasionally glance at screen to correct the mistakes I've
made.

I surely hope something happens because I don't know if I can stand that
much boredom.

### Saturday, 1. am



  ------------------------------

  Slovakian border
  ------------------------------

We stopped in Slovakia for lunch. In a restaurant that was something
like 20m from the highway. They only had three dishes and everything was
mediocre. Reading signs was a mood lifter. Slovenian and [Slovakian
language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_language "Slovak language")
are quite close, but not the same. So “out of order sign” on the toilet
read as “don't eat”. Not to mention that Slovakian word for soup is a
curse word in Finnish.

And back to the bus. I've grown to like Poirot. Apart from his ego, he's
quite a likable character. I'd probably die of boredom if I wouldn't
watch the movies. And then was fog. Lots of it. And there was the end of
the highway... And we still had nearly 100km to go. All in all the trip
was 14 hours long.

  Food in the fancy restaurant
  -----------------------------------------

Hotel is real nice! Four stars and solid internet connection in
rooms(that's what matters!). I got lucky and got a room of my own, while
others are sharing rooms for two. Or is that bad for me?

Anyway..I check my emails, talk to my girlfriend, give up on amount of
unprocessed info on social networks and go hang out with new friends.
And because we're programmers hanging out means going to dinner in a
fancy restaurant at midnight and drinking tea. Poland is cheap! The
restaurant was really nice but I don't believe anyone paid more than
5€(converted from their currency). 

Only problem was that our hotel is something like a 35 minute walk from
city center. And we had zero idea how to use public transport. And it's
quite cold outside. But tea warmed us up. And time passed by quickly
because conversations were interesting. I like hanging out with smart
guys.



### Saturday, 11. pm

  ------------------------------

  My wannabe English breakfast
  ------------------------------

Today was way better. Breakfast was ok. Apart from weird
meat-with-marmalade thingy that I ate accidentally. Then a trip to
university where actual competition will take place. I couldn't remember
it's name if my life depended on it. Starts with J. We got here at 10pm
so we missed registrations on Friday so we had to do late registration
today. Got some prospects and an ugly t-shirt. Opening
ceremony..blablabla...and a nice lecture on cryptology. Prezi and live
demos. And a good delivery. +1 for that polish student. Now I finally
understand elliptic curve cryptography.



And then an organization [epic
fail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure "Failure"). They mis-planed
for an hour and a half. So a quick walk to hotel was in order...because
we didn't have wifi at the university. Another fail.

And another with lunch. They ran out of food(that wasn't even that good)
and even drinks. Kinda disappointed here.

Then the practice session. Apparently the polish take security very
seriously. We had to show ids to enter. And weren't even allowed snacks
in the computer room. Nothing special about the problems. We've solved
some and ranked somewhere in the middle. Though it may be that this
problems were easy compared with what's coming up, since a few teams
solved all of them pretty much in matter of minutes.

But that's not the interesting part of the day. The interesting part was
seeing Krakow. This is weird coming from my mouth since I'm not much of
a travel person. But I truly enjoyed seeing a different culture.
Although it would be much better if it weren't for dense fog that
obscures anything more than 50m away. It destroys pictures too.

And polish cuisine isn't half bad too. We visited a restaurant with
traditional [polish
food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_cuisine "Polish cuisine") in
city centre. Had some laughs about dish names and talking to the
waitresses. Our coaches are some real funny(dare I say special) guys.
Two mathematicians and a sysadmin(not sure??) with a thing for [Slavic
languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_languages "Slavic languages").
I surely hope for more adventures.

### Sunday, 20. pm

Well things started early today. Woke up at seven to pack stuff and have
breakfast before checking out at 8am and leaving for the university. And
I still can't remember it's name. I tried, I really tried.

  -------------------------------

  Krakow at night. In fog.
  -------------------------------

There was a brief introduction with few announcements and at 9.30 the
party started. It was some intense five hours. There were 11 problems
and winners solved 10 of them. We've got correct results on 2 and ranked
56 among 77 teams. But I get my peace from knowing we've got correct
ideas for two more and just got a few bugs in the code and nearly got
the right approach for one more. But we've failed miserably at the last
problem we solved. Oh yeah, in case you don't know at CERC you get a
problem, write a program and then the test system compiles it and runs
tests. If it passes **all of them** you get a point. Else you get
nothing. So that was fun. I need more practice.

Then a weird spot in the schedule. Two hours of free time instead out
food there wasn't anything special. Yes food is that important to me.

  ----------------------------

  ----------------------------

There was a lecture on problem solutions afterwards...and the hardest
problems were really puzzling. Especially the one nobody solved. I
didn't get any of that. It would probably help if I've read the problem
statement.

Oh yeah, the really cool part is you get a helium balloon attached to
your table when you solve a problem. So you can see how everybody is
progressing. Like you need that when you have online real-time
ranking...but it's fun having balloons.

The ceremony went on forever. They shown picture of half the teams and
invited about 20 of them on stage. Banquet after was more of a failure
too. More chatting and slovenian teams boarded the bus. And now' we're
driving home. It's currently 8.34 an we've got something like 12 hours
more to drive. Apparently we'll watch some movies, but it's gonna be one
long ride. Not to mention sleeping on a bus leaves you in a much worse
state. Neck pain, back pain, you-part-you-didn't-even-know-can-hur
pain... Yay. CERC is in Krakow next year too, and Slovenia will probably
be going with a bus again. But I still wanna qualify. Because despite
all the inconveniences it means hanging out with cool guys, seeing a
nice city, solving interesting problems and competing with some of the
smartest people in my generation(there are many world gold medalists
from central Europe). Now I just need to practice. And perhaps get a
mentorship.
