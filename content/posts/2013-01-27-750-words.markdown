 ------------------

This week I felt the impulse
to express myself multiple times. I felt like
[writing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing "Writing"). Being a bit
sentimental I opened up a notepad I got from my girlfriend as a birthday
present and began a brain dump. A [stream
of consciousness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness_%28narrative_mode%29 "Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)").
But my handwriting is painfully slow. This means I had time to do
reformatting and rewording in my mind. Sot this was **definitely not** a
brain dump. I wasn't expressing my thoughts directly but rather doing
some writing - I don't know how to put this subtle(but important)
difference better. And after 2 small(<A5 format) pages I gave up. I
kinda wanna keep a journal  but this is too much work for too little
return.

### Enter interwebs

Then I remembered this awesome site
[750words.com](http://www.750words.com). I've seen it before but I
didn't feel the need to use it. Now it somehow hopped back into my mind.
It is meant just for just the thing I need - writing unprocessed brain
dump. Apparently this is a thing amongst writers and they call it
Morning Pages because it's usually done in the morning. I'm only using
it for two days so not much experience here but it just feels good.
Yesterday I wrote in the evening and it was more reporting/diary style
and today I wrote in the morning(two hours after I got up) and it was
more reflecting style; expressing my thoughts. Why not just use
[Office](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx "Microsoft Office")(I
like [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org "LibreOffice") as I don't
have and [Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/WINDOWS "Windows") machines)
you ask? I gives you space to type anything without putting it on the
internet. There is something special about just opening a page and
writing. Like picking up a notebook... It handles days for you. And it's
suposed to be private. And all your data is on all machines. Because
it's, you konw, on the
[Internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"). This means
I don't need to spend time fussing over technical details and I can
**just write**. And it also looks kinda beautiful.  There's a word
counter too, the idea is to write at least 750 words, because this is
enough you cannot just blurt it out but have to dig into yourself a bit.
But it's not to much. And the idea is also to do this **every single
day** to get into the habit. So you get points and badges(a bit silly
but nice) and also compete in challenges(to see if you can hold out an
entire month).

### Analytics

The super duper awesome part is analytics. It uses some fancy machine
learning to analyze what you write. For a started you get a feedback on
your typing(something I wanna improve). But then things get nice. I
tells you how you feel and what are you concerned about. If you are
writeing more extroverted or introverted, positive or negative, in wich
time are you oriented, most used words and more. And the best of
it: **it is correct**. At least for my two entries so far it got me
figured out. It points out stuff you wouldn't normally think about. And
you also get archiving and over time analytics. And of course you can
export your data. The only downside is I have to type in
[English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language")
which isn't my primary language(or should I say [mother
tongue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_language "First language")).
But wit internet I grew accustomed that my typing is mostly English so
it feels natural. It's about as weird for me to type in
[Slovene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_language "Slovene language")
as it is to hand-write English. That is
not-really-weird-but-not-very-natural(Sorry for the hyphen abuse but I
feel this should be one word). So I don't mind, it's totally worth it.
Give 750words a shot. It only takes a few minutes a day.
