title: About me
---

My name is Andraz and I work as a software engineer. Sometimes writing code
(mostly Go) but mostly telling others what and how to write. But more
importantly I'm a curious human. And when I feel like it I write about my
explorations here on this blog.

In my free time I'm often playing around with various statically-typed
functional programming "things". But work has also led me in the direction of
distributed systems and low latency which both turned out of great interest as
well.

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:blog@edofic.com).
